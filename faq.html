                            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">The Toyger is a relatively new breed that was specifically developed to resemble a "toy tiger" - hence the name. These stunning domestic cats feature distinctive orange coats with dramatic black stripes, creating a mini-tiger appearance that cat enthusiasts adore.</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Unlike their wild tiger counterparts, Toygers are completely domesticated, affectionate companions that make wonderful family pets. Their striking appearance combined with their friendly temperament has made them increasingly popular among cat lovers worldwide.</p>

                        <h2 id="history" class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">History & Origin of the Toyger Breed</h2>
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">The Toyger breed was developed in the 1980s by breeder Judy Sugden, daughter of Jean Mill who created the Bengal cat breed. Judy's vision was to create a domestic cat with branching stripes resembling a tiger's coat pattern.</p>
                        
                        <div class="bg-gray-100 border-l-4 border-primary p-4 my-6 rounded-r-lg">
                            <p class="italic text-gray-700">"My goal was to create a cat that would remind people of the endangered wild tiger and perhaps inspire them to protect these magnificent animals in the wild."</p>

                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">The breeding program began with a mackerel tabby domestic shorthair named Scrappy, who had unusual spots on his temples that resembled the circular markings found on tiger heads. Through careful selective breeding with Bengal cats and other domestic shorthairs, the distinctive Toyger pattern was developed.</p>
                        
                        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">The International Cat Association (TICA) recognized the Toyger as a registered breed in 1993 and granted it championship status in 2007. While still relatively rare, Toygers continue to grow in popularity as more breeders join the effort to refine and develop this striking breed.</p>

                        <p class="mb-6">Toygers are medium-sized cats with muscular bodies, weighing between 7-15 pounds when fully grown. Their most notable feature is their stunning coat pattern – dark stripes on a bright orange background, resembling a tiger's coat. Unlike typical tabby patterns, Toyger stripes are often branched or broken, creating a more random, wild appearance.</p>

                                            <p class="text-gray-600">The Toyger is a designer domestic cat breed developed to resemble a "toy tiger," as its name suggests. It was created by breeding domestic shorthair tabbies with the goal of producing a cat with branching stripes and circular patterns similar to the markings on tigers. Toygers are medium-sized cats with bright orange coats with dramatic black stripes, and they are known for their friendly, outgoing personalities.</p>

They produce the protein Fel d 1, which is the primary cause of cat allergies in humans. However, individual cats may produce varying levels of this protein, and some people with mild allergies may find they can tolerate certain cats better than others. If you have allergies, we recommend spending time with Toygers before deciding to adopt.</p>

In fact, keeping them indoors is recommended for their safety and health. To keep indoor Toygers happy, provide plenty of vertical space for climbing, interactive toys for mental stimulation, and daily play sessions. Some owners also harness-train their Toygers for safe outdoor exploration.</p>

                                            <p class="text-gray-600">Toygers typically have a lifespan of 12-15 years, though some may live longer with proper care. As with all cats, factors that influence longevity include genetics, diet, exercise, preventative healthcare, and whether they're kept indoors or allowed outdoors. Regular veterinary check-ups and a nutritious diet can help maximize your Toyger's lifespan.</p>
